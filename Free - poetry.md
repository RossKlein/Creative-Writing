The shivering day wakes up screaming out of the night with blood in its hands <br>
A bald eagle soars with talons so sharp, <br>
strikes fear in those eyes so far below that peer up at the open sky<br>
<br>
An Orange glow silhouetted by an eerie, dark streak in the sky.<br>
Regal throws propel the gladiator across the horizon<br>
True freedom<br>
Kicking through the sky<br>


On the edge of a peninsula an observer fares,<br>
From a pontoon near the coast, a man perched, bearing witness the act of solitude<br>
